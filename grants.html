      <h3>Early Detection and Rapid Response Invasive Species Control Program for Private Lands and Refuges</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</p>
      <p>
        This funding agreement is a cooperative effort with Homer SWCD. Through this agreement, Anchorage SWCD was able
        to hire our Invasive Species Program Leader, Hannah, in October 2022. Hannah attended training, developed
        partnerships, set up a GIS database which incorporates invasive species data from multiple stakeholders, set up a
        system for collecting field data on invasive species infestations, became involved in the Anchorage Cooperative
        Invasive Species Management Area (ANC-CISMA), and helped lead a Prioritization Workshop to prioritize species
        and locations for invasive species management within the Anchorage SWCD boundaries. Hannah worked with
        ANC-CISMA partners to edit and add content to a Strategic Management Plan for the Anchorage area, which will be
        finalized in winter 2023-24.

      <h3>Alaska Good Neighbor Authority High-Priority Invasive Plant Surveys and Restoration on BLM-Adjacent Lands</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> BLM</p>
      <p>
        The overall goal of this project is to restore and maintain the integrity of Anchorage’s forested ecosystem,
        including the riparian functions, by keeping invasive plant species under control so diverse and resilient
        native plant communities can thrive. ASWCD staff and volunteers will:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
        <li>Work with BLM and other ANC-Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area (CISMA) partners to refine the
          priority species and survey locations for this project area;</li>
        <li>Survey lands adjacent to the BLM Campbell Tract for the presence of invasive plants and document their
          presence or absence by submitting data to the Alaska Exotic Plants Information Clearinghouse (AKEPIC);</li>
        <li>Develop an adaptable restoration plan for treatment sites in riparian areas;</li>
        <li>Review infestation data relative to ANC-CISMA priorities for invasive plant management;</li>
        <li>Manage high-priority infestations using integrated pest management techniques;</li>
        <li>Actively restore degraded areas by replanting native species if necessary to achieve healthy plant
          communities.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In late May 2023, Hannah and our new Invasive Species Technician, Ryan, began surveying lands adjacent to the BLM
        Campbell Tract for invasive species.</p>

      <h3>Cooperative Invasive Plant Management: Chugach National Forest Kenai Peninsula Zone North</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> U.S. Forest Service</p>
      <p>
        Anchorage SWCD will be performing control work on high priority invasive plant species in areas bordering
        Chugach National Forest beginning in summer 2023. Control work will be based on sound integrated pest management
        principles and practices and sites will be re-vegetated as needed with native plants to restore the treatment
        areas to a healthy vegetative community. We will develop and build partnerships with local community volunteers,
        stakeholders, and ANC-CISMA members to build capacity in managing invasive species as well as educating
        landowners and the public about the identification and management of invasive species.

      <h3>Alaska Invasive Plant Mini-Grant Program</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> Copper River Watershed Project</p>
      <p>
        This small project is focused on control of Prunus padus and Prunus virginiana in Anchorage and vicinity. We
        have developed a Frequently Asked Questions Fact Sheet which explains Prunus control measures and complements
        existing Cooperative Extension Service publications. Anchorage SWCD staff and volunteers have visited several
        Prunus infestation sites to investigate control options and identify a suitable site for removing Prunus and
        hosting volunteer event(s) this summer. We plan to complete at least one Prunus control demonstration project
        this year using funds from the Mini-Grant.
      </p>

      <h3>Prunus Control Grant Phase IV</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources Division of Forestry & Fire Protection</p>
      <p>
        This project is focused on survey of invasive Prunus padus and Prunus virginiana in select areas of the
        Municipality of Anchorage, particularly areas bordering wild lands such as Chugach State Park. Anchorage SWCD
        will begin reaching out to landowners on properties with these plants present to assess interest in removing the
        trees and discuss options for management.

      <h3>Whittier Integrated Pest Management</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> U.S. Forest Service through a Memorandum of Agreement with Kenai Watershed Forum</p>
      <p>
        Priority terrestrial invasive species will be treated using an integrated pest management approach during summer
        2023 within the Whittier area. Whittier will be surveyed for invasive species and the data submitted to the AK
        Exotic Plants Information Clearinghouse.

      <h3>Southcentral Alaska Native Plant Production</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</p>
      <p>
        Anchorage SWCD is working in partnership with Palmer SWCD, Wasilla SWCD, Eklutna Tribal Conservation District,
        and Knik Tribal Conservation District to build four-five small local outdoor native plant nurseries. These
        nurseries will serve as sites to propagate native plant species for use in ecological restoration projects such
        as culvert replacements, streambank erosion control projects, etc. We have hired a Native Plants Program
        Leader, Dana, who will implement this program and be the technical advisor for the project. Native plant seed
        will be collected locally and stored at the Plant Materials Center. This project is collaborative and builds
        capacity at the Soil and Water Conservation Districts and Tribes for the development of a new native plants
        industry to supply an unmet need within the state for hardy regionally appropriate restoration plants and seed.

      <h3>JBER Cooperative Agreements</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</p>
      <p>
        Anchorage SWCD is working in partnership with Palmer SWCD on 3 Scopes of Work on JBER. These projects include
        vegetative management, hazard mitigation, and improvements to the Malamute Drop Zone on JBER. Palmer SWCD is
        the Project Manager for the current projects within the Anchorage SWCD’s boundaries and the work is managed
        under a Memorandum of Understanding between the Districts.

      <h3>Urban Agriculture Technical Assistance and Outreach in Anchorage</h3>
      <p><strong>Funder:</strong> Natural Resource Conservation Service</p>
      <p>
        Anchorage SWCD will serve as a local contact for the Alaska NRCS in the Anchorage area and will conduct
        outreach to increase awareness of NRCS programs and technical assistance resources within the Anchorage SWCD
        boundaries. We will support the Wasilla NRCS Office with outreach efforts or technical assistance within the
        Anchorage SWCD boundaries. Anchorage SWCD staff will provide technical assistance to landowners who reach out
        to the Anchorage SWCD about resource concerns including nutrient management, manure management, forest health,
        etc. Anchorage SWCD will help set up and staff booths at conferences and/or the State Fair. We will organize
        the Local Working Group with Anchorage area partners. Workshops will be hosted in Anchorage addressing natural
        resource conservation topics and our staff will actively reach out to local farms to offer our services and
        technical assistance. This funding agreement helps build capacity for our District and will allow us to hire 1
        person to assist the Anchorage SWCD District Manager with the agriculture and soils programs. This person will
        attend training as available through NRCS and will be trained internally in nutrient management, Alaskan
        agriculture, and natural resource management.
