<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>2022-2023 Urban Agriculture grant:</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Alaska produces only five percent of its food, almost none of it in Anchorage (resulting in $1.9 billion leaving the state). Grocery stores have only a 3-5 day supply of most foods. Anchorage&rsquo;s (and Alaska&rsquo;s) food system is vulnerable because production is far away and connections of food to people are not a robust network. The Food Bank of Alaska estimates that one in seven people are food-insecure at any time, including one in five children (pre-pandemic).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">There is a strong demand for Alaska-grown food, as demonstrated by local support of farmers&rsquo; markets, community supported agriculture, and Alaska Grown initiatives. However, as the largest urban area, with over 40% of the state&rsquo;s population, Anchorage has unique challenges in supporting urban agriculture, improving food security, and increasing consumption of Alaska produced food. There are many groups already working to promote urban agriculture and food security in Anchorage. Our goal is to determine how best the Anchorage SWCD can assist and strengthen these efforts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Anchorage is the most populated and diverse city in Alaska. However, it lacks a fully staffed Cooperative Extension office, does not have a Natural Resources Conservation Service office, and the Agricultural Research Service is not in Alaska at all. Our farmers and gardeners are highly underserved when it comes to conservation technical assistance. In other areas of Alaska, Conservation Districts have stepped up to fill some of these gaps.&nbsp;As a newly re-formed Conservation District, the first step will be to make connections and find out what the existing needs are that are not being fulfilled within our area. Using this information, the Anchorage SWCD can formulate a strategic plan to address some of these gaps.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">As we work to assess the needs within our area and look at potential future projects, we will strive to answer the following questions:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(1) What populations lack food in Anchorage and&nbsp;who is working to serve them?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(2) Are there producers that would like to grow more? If so, what holds them back?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(3) Are people in Anchorage who grow their own food lacking something they need, such as information, equipment, or suitable crop varieties?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(4) What are the barriers for people who aspire to become agricultural producers?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The Anchorage SWCD plans to&nbsp;assess the conservation technical assistance needs of our community and opportunities to improve the food security of Anchorage by:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Reviewing the existing reports that have been produced on Anchorage's food security, agricultural production, and associated environmental conditions.</li>
<li>Participating in the 2022 Alaska Food Festival and Conference, the 2022 Alaska Master Gardeners Conference, and the 2022 Alaska Association of Conservation Districts Conference to build partnerships for future urban agriculture projects. They will also provide opportunities for identifying which local conservation technical assistance needs are being unmet in our community.</li>
<li>Investigating the distribution of Alaska Grown foods within Anchorage and the accessibility of those foods to Anchorage's diverse ethnic and underserved populations. In doing so, we will look for opportunities where the distribution and accessibility could be improved.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Determining what partnerships are possible to promote programs such as AgrAbility, which makes agricultural production accessible to individuals with disabilities. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Reaching out to Alaska&rsquo;s network of community gardens to find out how we can support them or possible opportunities for expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Engaging the local Alaska native Eklutna tribe, Anchorage's largest private landholder, to identify their conservation technical assistance needs are and possible areas of partnership in the future.</li>
<li>Interviewing stakeholders along the web of food production, import, processing, and consumption in Anchorage to find out their unmet needs and opportunities for Anchorage SWCD to play a role in supporting them. Additionally, we plan to interview social service entitities who are familiar with Anchorage&rsquo;s underserved populations and what their needs are; e.g. Food Bank, Alaska Community Foundation, Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium, Cook Inlet Tribal Council, and Southcentral Foundation.</li>
<li>Meeting with the Natural Resources Conservation Service&rsquo;s (NRCS) state office and Wasilla office to explore opportunities for outreach in Anchorage and future partnerships.</li>
<li>Investigating the possibility of setting up a drop off location for soil samples to be aggregated and sent to an out of state lab for analysis, or the possibility of starting a soil testing program in which Anchorage SWCD staff would interpret the soil test results for landowners in our area.</li>
<li>Reporting on all our findings through quarterly and annual reports. The annual report will include a summary of all the information collected, a list and description of ranked project ideas for Anchorage SWCD to pursue in the future, and maps/diagrams of local food production and distribution within our District boundaries (extending to where food is produced and then sent to Anchorage, such as the Matanuska-Susitna valley).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once Anchorage SWCD has made progress toward understanding the technical assistance needs and opportunities for improving the food security of Anchorage, our board members will be able to identify potential projects and look for funding. We will list and prioritize which projects we think are the best choices for Anchorage SWCD to pursue. We plan to discuss these projects with numerous partner organizations to help assess the feasibility of the different ideas.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Urban agriculture is one of the top priorities for our District. This funding will help us to identify future projects that are needed, achievable, and can make an impact. The Anchorage SWCD is very newly re-formed, and this grant opportunity is a perfect fit for the type of initial planning and networking that will help us to be successful in the future.&nbsp;</p>
